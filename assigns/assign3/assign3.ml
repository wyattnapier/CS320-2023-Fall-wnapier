A matrix can be represented as a list of lists.
For instance, [[1;2;3];[4;5;6];[7;8;9]] represents
the following 3x3 square matrix:
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
Please implement matrix_transpose that returns
the transpose of a given matrix:
let rec
matrix_transpose(xss: 'a list list): 'a list list
For instance, the transpose of the above matrix
is given as follows:
1 4 7
2 5 8
3 6 9
You are allowed to define recursive functions to
solve this problem.

The function [list_subsets]
returns all the subsets of a given
set (where sets are represented as lists)
//
let rec
list_subsets
(xs: 'a list): 'a list list =
(
match xs with
  [] -> [[]]
| x1 :: xs ->
  let res = list_subsets(xs) in
    res @ list_map(res, fun(xs) -> x1 :: xs)
)
//
Please give a NON-RECURSIVE implementation of
list_subsets based on list-combinators. Note that
the order of the elements in a list representation
of a set is insignificant. For instance, [1,2] and
[2,1] represents the same set {1,2}.

The function [list_nchoose(xs)(n0)]
returns all the subsequences of xs that are
of length n0.
//
let rec
list_nchoose
(xs: 'a list)(n0: int): 'a list list =
//
Please give a NON-RECURSIVE implementation of
list_nchoose based on list-combinators. Note that
the order of the elements in a list representation
of a subsequenc is SIGNIFICANT. For instance, [1;2]
and [2;1] are DIFFERENT.

Given a word x of length n, another word is a buddy
of x if x and y differ exactly at one position. For
instance, "live" is a buddy "love" (and "love" is also
a buddy of "live").
//
Please give a NON-RECURSIVE implementation of
list_of_buddies that returns a list of all the buddies
of a given word.
//
let
list_of_buddies(word: string): string list = ...

(*
FYI. The concept of word buddies is used in the following game:

Here is an implementation of the famous 8-queen puzzle:
https://ats-lang.sourceforge.net/DOCUMENT/INT2PROGINATS/HTML/x631.html
//
Please give a NON-RECURSIVE implementation that solves the 8-queen puzzle.
//
Hint: Please think of programming in terms of combinators.
//
//
type board_t =
int * int * int * int * int * int * int * int
//
fun
queen8_puzzle_solve(): board_t list =
(*
returns a list of boards consisting of all the solutions to the puzzle.
